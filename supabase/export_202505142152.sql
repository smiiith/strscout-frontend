A pro has the experience to capture your space in the best possible light, ensuring that it looks both inviting and accurate.

Open all windows, use light-colored curtains, and avoid harsh overhead lights. Natural light enhances the warmth and appeal of the space, making it feel more inviting.\n                               \n            Use Wide Angles: When photographing rooms, use wide-angle shots to capture the entire space. This helps give viewers a sense of the room''s size and layout.

Natural light enhances the warmth and appeal of the space, making it feel more inviting.\n                               \n            Use Wide Angles: When photographing rooms, use wide-angle shots to capture the entire space. This helps give viewers a sense of the room''s size and layout. Avoid tight or cluttered shots, as they can make the space feel smaller than it actually is.\n                               \n            Focus on Clean and Tidy Staging: Before you take the photo, clear away any clutter. Neatly arrange furniture and decor to make the space look polished and functional. The simpler and more streamlined the space appears, the more likely it is to resonate with potential guests."], "property_name": "Unique Experience Stay", "rating_number": 76, "expert_ratings": [82, 77, 75, 80, 71, 68, 65, 78, 82, 76, 74, 77, 79, 73, 70, 64, 72, 75, 78, 81, 77, 72, 68, 74, 76, 80, 71, 69, 73, 78, 82, 70, 71, 79, 75, 77, 76, 74, 72, 82, 67, 69, 77, 76, 75, 78, 73, 80, 76, 72, 79, 81, 68, 74, 70, 77, 75, 69, 80, 73, 81, 75, 79, 68, 72, 76, 78, 72, 74, 70, 71, 78, 79, 81, 73, 68, 74, 76, 75, 82, 78, 80, 77, 69, 72, 74, 71, 76, 78, 81, 79, 77, 70, 73, 76, 75, 82, 78, 79, 71], "rating_category": "Satisfactory"}, "interior_design": {"feedback": {"items": [{"title": "Color Scheme", "feedback": "The color palette is warm and inviting, complementing the desert surroundings elegantly."}, {"title": "Furniture Choices", "feedback": "The furniture strikes a nice balance between style and comfort, enhancing the overall ambiance."}, {"title": "Spatial Layout", "feedback": "The flow and layout of the cabin offer a functional yet relaxed vibe for various activities."}, {"title": "Lighting Fixtures", "feedback": "The lighting enhances the mood beautifully while allowing for versatility in usage."}, {"title": "Decor Elements", "feedback": "Unique decor elements contribute to the character and charm, resonating well with the desert experience."}], "summary": "Your interior design beautifully blends retro modern aesthetics with a cozy desert ambiance, making it a lovely escape for guests."}, "revisions": null, "suggestions": ["Consider incorporating more local art for a unique touch.", "Add more plants or greenery to enhance the lively atmosphere.", "Think about using lighter furniture to keep the space feeling fresh and airy."], "property_name": "DTJT House 1 - SWIM, SOAK & STARGAZE", "rating_number": 85, "expert_ratings": [92, 88, 76, 85, 79, 81, 93, 82, 78, 83, 70, 87, 80, 90, 76, 91, 86, 77, 75, 88, 89, 95, 80, 72, 84, 81, 78, 90, 85, 79, 88, 92, 93, 76, 83, 95, 74, 81, 76, 87, 84, 88, 89, 70, 82, 75, 81, 94, 91, 77, 86, 75, 90, 81, 89, 87, 94, 81, 72, 86, 88, 99, 84, 79, 87, 86, 92, 80, 72, 86, 93, 84, 88, 74, 82, 85, 90, 94, 90, 75, 99, 88, 82, 78, 85, 96, 78, 73, 76, 81, 78, 76, 88, 75, 91, 72, 84, 82, 93, 79, 92, 86, 80, 94, 86, 84, 77, 73, 92, 90, 87, 74, 85, 91, 88], "rating_category": "Good"}, "overall_ratings": {"feedback": {"items": [{"title": "Location Context", "feedback": "Adding ''in Joshua Tree'' could help potential guests instantly identify the setting."}, {"title": "Unique Features", "feedback": "Mentioning the saltwater pool and hot tub could draw more attention."}, {"title": "Audience Targeting", "feedback": "Consider specifying if this is family-friendly or ideal for couples, which could help attract the right guests."}], "summary": "Your title effectively highlights unique selling points such as swimming and stargazing, making it appealing.

Avoid tight or cluttered shots, as they can make the space feel smaller than it actually is.\n                               \n            Focus on Clean and Tidy Staging: Before you take the photo, clear away any clutter.

A pro has the experience to capture your space in the best possible light, ensuring that it looks both inviting and accurate.

Open all windows, use light-colored curtains, and avoid harsh overhead lights. Natural light enhances the warmth and appeal of the space, making it feel more inviting.\n                               \n            Use Wide Angles: When photographing rooms, use wide-angle shots to capture the entire space. This helps give viewers a sense of the room''s size and layout. Avoid tight or cluttered shots, as they can make the space feel smaller than it actually is.\n                               \n            Focus on Clean and Tidy Staging: Before you take the photo, clear away any clutter.

Remote A-Frame off-grid cabin with expansive ocean and mountain views.  On a clear day, enjoy an expansive view of the Pacific Ocean.  The A-Frame is located in a former avocado grove that is slowly being re-established with diverse permaculture. Everything is provided for cooking and eating, as well as a hot shower and composting toilet.  The bed will be made for you with clean bedding.

The space
The A-Frame is built on a large deck with about 300 square feet.  The walls and ceiling are constructed of 2x6 lumber and canvas stretched over it and metal roofing. There is a Cal King sized bed, plus a twin xl bed in the loft.  Additional space for a fourth guest on a large comfortable leather sofa. Propane is provided for the gas grill, shower, portable space heater and gas fire-pit on the back deck.  

The kitchen has a mini-fridge with a freezer, sink, and all the basic cooking supplies: pots and pans, spatula, cups, plates, and silverware. Trash bins are available with extra trash bags if needed. We also offer free Starbucks coffee and tea. 

There is a composting toilet made out of a rustic wine barrel. The shower has on demand hot water. It is always stocked with body wash, shampoo, towels, and washcloths. 

Wake up with some morning coffee or tea to this incredible view of the ocean and mountains. There is lots of wildlife to see such as red tailed hawks who love to fly right above and dive around the hills. You will also see lots of hummingbirds and an occasional golden eagle. We also have had rare sightings of little bobcats and coyotes, but don''t worry they are harmless to humans.
Bailes Farm is an 80-acre property in northern San Diego county, nestled between the greater metropolitan areas of Los Angeles-Orange County and San Diego. From the property there are expansive views of the entire coastline of San Diego, as well as views of the snow capped peak of Southern California’s highest mountain, San Gorgonio, at 11,503 ft.
Located just 12 miles from the Pacific Ocean, the property’s climate is moderated by a gentle breeze from the ocean. The farm is situated on a miniature mountain that rises up 1,500ft above the nearby valley, not only creating a spectacular vantage point, but also a unique microclimate resulting from ocean moisture condensing as it’s forced to rise.  The moisture nourishes a 20 acre avocado grove, in addition to 60 acres of native chaparral, which features a healthy population of the beautiful Manzanita tree, an endangered species protected by law.
The nearby Santa Margarita River Preserve minutes away provides hikers with access to an extensive hiking network along the river. The larger area is shielded from development and highways by the Cleveland National Forest. There is no traffic noise, and the air is the cleanest in Southern California.

It''s got one of the best yards in Palm Springs with total privacy, a large pool, spa, mountain views, pergola, built-in grill + gorgeous landscaping. Walls of glass blur the inside + outdoors, giving the home a stunning backdrop. I take great pride in making sure the house is absolutely perfect & being available for my guests. My reviews say it all!  Available for shoots. CITY ID#1830

The space
This absolutely fabulous light and bright mid-century, post-and-beam classic 2,250-square-foot home is as private as you can get and features walls of glass facing the huge backyard, pool, and spa. This is a simply stunning home that exemplifies classic mid-century architecture and indoor/outdoor living and entertaining. It''s a quintessential Palm Springs compound!

Inside is a gourmet kitchen, a giant living room, three bedrooms (two with direct access to yard), and two and a half baths. Outside, there''s an absolutely amazing fenced and gated private backyard with fantastic mountain views, two outdoor fireplaces, a large pool that can be heated for an additional fee with an in-ground spa/hot tub and cascading waterfalls surrounded by lush landscaping and an awesome, shaded steel pergola lounge area with firepit and overhead dimmable lighting. A great hangout night or day! There''s also a  new outdoor kitchen with built-in high-end gas grill, gas burner, lots of counter space, lighting, sink, spray faucet, and kitchen storage.  One of our favorite features is the luxurious open-air rainfall outdoor shower. The desert-lanscaped front yard also includes a seating area and more mountain views. 

We recently put in stunning, brand-new terrazzo-style floors (throughout the entire house, including the bedrooms) and new quartz countertops in the kitchen. They look amazing!

The home is decorated in true mid-century style with a curated mix of new and mid-century vintage pieces. Design and architecture buffs will love it (but so will everyone else). 

Deepwell is one of Palm Springs'' most sought-after neighborhoods full of gorgeous mid-century homes and a short walk to South Palm Springs businesses. Downtown is a quick drive, bike ride, Buzz or Uber away!

PLEASE NOTE that a city-required 12.5% occupancy tax is added to the reservation by Airbnb
If you opt for OPTIONAL pool heat, a fee of $85/night (November-March) will be added to the reservation via special offer and $75/night all other months.  Unlike at most rental homes, spa heat is complimentary. Hooray!!!

Other things to note
PLEASE NOTE that a city-required 12.5% occupancy tax is added to the reservation by Airbnb.

CITY ID# 1830

By booking our home for a stay, you agree to comply with the below house rules in their entirety.  

•	No smoking by anyone anywhere in the house or in the backyard.  We collect vintage ashtrays simply for purposes of vintage décor – not for smoking.  If you wish to smoke, please smoke in the front desert-scape yard away from the house, and discard your trash in the outside city garbage can. 

•	No loud amplified music. (Palm Springs city ordinance states that no outdoor amplified music is allowed to be played by renters at any time, day or night). We understand that that is a ridiculous ordinance but If neighbors can hear it in their yard, it is too loud and they will likely call the police/hotline. As of March 15, 2017, Audible music at the property line is now punishable with a $500 fine by the city, which is fined to the guest.

•	No engaging in loud outdoor activities on the premises so as to create a nuisance to any persons residing on properties surrounding our property. Again, reasonable outdoor activities are fine. Please be respectful of our neighbors. As of March 15, 2017 noise from property that exceeds 40 decibels after 10pm at the neighboring property line is punishable with a $500 fine by the city, which is fined to the guest.

•	You will be responsible for any and all fines assessed to the owners resulting from your or your guests actions, including and without limitation resulting from city agency citations during rental period, and you acknowledge and agree that we have the right to apply your security deposit to any such amounts.

•	No more than six (6) adult occupants overnight or eight (8) daytime occupants on the premises total.

•	No commercial usage of the premises, including for purposes of filming, photography or other content production, without making prior arrangements with owners.  We charge an extra fee for commercial usage. 

•	Engaging in any illegal activity, including the use of illegal drugs, on the premises is strictly prohibited.

•	No pets (including emotional support animals) allowed on the premises without our approval. If you bring a pet without first obtaining our approval, you agree to an additional pet fee of $100 per night. If you’ve been approved to bring a pet, we welcome your dog to Mod Mesquite, but while you are here, the following rules apply:

o	Please do not allow your dog to urinate on the grass in the backyard; steer him or her to the rocks or anywhere in the front yard where it is entirely sand/desertscape. We really appreciate your cooperation with this – and so do our future guests!
o	If your dog relieves itself on the grass, please clean it up immediately by soaking the area with water from the hose around the side of the house to minimize damage to grass. We really appreciate your cooperation with this – and so do our future guests!
o	Please don’t allow dogs on any of the furniture or beds.
o	Please clean up after your dog prior to checking out.
o	Please inform us immediately (prior to checkout) if your dog causes any damage.

Within walking distance from the center of town, it''s perfectly situated on a quiet street amongst the trees, buzzing with blue jays and hummingbirds. Curl up by the fireplace and enjoy surround-sound tunes, or have a spa-like soak after hitting the nearby trails. As a creative couple ourselves, we designed this space for romantic getaways and creative retreats.

The space
We built this home with creativity in mind. So if you’re looking for a place to be creative in nature, look no further. 

*We newly installed AC & heating throughout the cabin.

- The classic lofted A-frame bedroom does not have a door. The bedroom next to it does have a door. The master bedroom downstairs has a hatch door you can close for privacy.

- Please note that we have a security Nest camera in the outside front driveway and outside the lower deck doorway. We also have a county mandated outdoor noise monitor on the front deck.

-QUIET HOURS:
Quiet hours are 10pm - 8pm in respect to our permanent neighbors.

- Only use main paved road to walk into town. Do not access any private roads through the back of the cabin as to not trespass on neighbor''s property. 

- In the warmer months we put up a hammock area on the side of the cabin that you can enjoy.

- On a clear night, the star visibility is incredible. We recommend downloading a stargazing app, sitting on the back deck at night, and enjoying the constellations.

* Sorry, we cannot host weddings or events as we are not set up for this.
* The HVAC system serves these two domes alone, with fans that can bring in fresh air from the outside. As the walls curve both vertically and horizontally, the windows do not open. If you need open windows, open the sliding glass door with screen. 
* The HVAC system can cool these domes to 72 degrees Farenheit, but not lower due to the huge volume of air the domes enclose. If you need a home that runs cooler, please don''t book these domes.
* The unique features of this dome home is the architecture, the wonderful acoustics, the enclosed courtyard with BBQ and natural wood fire pit for star gazing, and the labyrinth  surrounded by a ring of 9-foot tall natural stone columns. 
* Please note there are a wide range of cafes, restaurants, deli, grocery store and take-out options nearby. the kitchenette has limited cooking options and fridge space.

Other things to note
Please know that this is a vintage 50''s cabin. It is clean and everything works, but it is not luxurious in any way. The home is only 600sqft total. This size includes the loft. There is no bathtub and the shower stall is very small to fit the space. There is no AC unit. The cabin does have multiple portable fans, including a ceiling fan to cool down the cabin during the summer months.

The property is fully fenced, but this does not mean you can leave your pets outside unattended.  There are coyotes and bears in the area and pets should be monitored at all times.  Also, the fences are about 4 feet tall and you should do a perimeter check to make sure your pet is unable to squeeze through or under any small openings.

Pet owners are responsible for picking up after their dogs, cleaning excess dog hair and they are responsible for controlling their dogs from being a barking nuisance.

There is no cable service to the TVs.  You will need to access your own TV apps on the smart TVs.

Share
Save','','','','www.airbnb.com/rooms/25687274','25687274','The lookout is open year round with a wood fired stove to keep warm at night or heat your morning coffee. A wood fired sauna sits below to relax and rejuvenate your body after a big hike or snowshoeing adventure. What''s that other little wooden building? No fire lookout is complete without an outhouse!

The space
Crystal Peak Lookout was built in 1959 and was originally located in Chewelah, WA on top of Stranger Peak. In 1983 it was moved to Northern Idaho to the cedar and tamarack lined slopes of Crystal Peak. Completely remodeled in 2018, Crystal Peak Lookout is now an immersive deep-forest getaway for adventurous couples. Surrounded by 13 wooded acres, you''ll find yourself sharing the sunset view with mountain bluebirds in the tree tops, gazing at the starlit skies while an owl calls from its neighboring perch, and if you''re lucky, waking up to the occasional passing moose.

Guest access
There’s 13 acres to wander around to your hearts content! Depending on the time of year you''ll find huckleberries ripe for the picking, tamarack needles beginning yellow, blue bird boxes full of nestlings, or fresh moose tracks in the snow. You’ll have full access to the lookout, an outhouse & sauna during your stay. Winter is accessed by snowmobile or by a ride in our Polaris razor (the winter wonderland experience)!

Other things to note
You must have a 4WD vehicle to access the lookout. In the winter which can start in late October you’ll need snowmobiles or the equivalent to get to the property. 

Now Available: Winter Wonderland Experience! It''s a rare & absolutely stunning to stay in a lookout in the snow. Our caretakers Bobby and Calandria will greet you in town with gourmet hot cocoa (Baileys optional)  & a Polaris razor. You''ll enjoy breath-taking 360 degree views of the snow covered forest on your way to the lookout. We''ll transport all your gear and food to the lookout and pick you up at the end of your stay. 

It''s a beautiful addition to staying at the lookout. It''s a $100 for the razor ride and we will add that to your booking if you''d like to reserve it. Also your welcome to tip your driver in person if you feel so inclined.

We''re two songs (on the radio) away from town, but secluded enough to where you will be in awe of the epic starry skies and totally feel off the grid. 

 FOR WARM DAYS:
We have an epic swimming pool. It''s big. We''re talking 50 feet long. It''s basically the "mullet" of pools. One side you can totally swim laps so that''s  the "work side." The other side has a tanning shelf and deep end bench which is,  the "play side." The winters are chilly so it''s not exactly swimming temps, but still awesome to sit by to read and hang.  

We have a cover that keeps dirt out and also can warm the pool 10 degrees or so, but the pool is not heated. Ideal swimming time is late April - Nov.

FOR COOL NIGHTS: 
We have a wonderful hot-tub so you can soak those hiking muscles under the constellations.  The hot tub is up by the pool and is your private hot tub. Cabin 2 has their own hot tub.

PRIVACY: Everyone asks because our cabins and property is sexy sexy (did I mention sexy?) and everyone who books returns! We have set up DTJT so you have privacy. You have your own private outdoor space with a propane firepit and an outdoor wood burning fire stove.  The other cabin on the property has their own private area and neither can see each other! 

DTJT House 1 offers a lovely, insanely comfy king size bed, full kitchen with eating area, comfy stools and a private bathroom. 

The kitchen has basic cookware and utensils (please feel free to bring anything special you might want to use.), a french press, water boiler, Brita water pitcher, along with coffee from Joshua Tree Coffee Co, tea, oatmeal, olive oil and basic seasonings as well as a few snacks if you get the munchies. 

There is a full size oven to bake a turkey in as well as a toaster oven.

We have a wall heater/AC and the bed heats as well. Options! 

There''s also a private outdoor shower that all guests have access to day and night, in addition to the shower and bath in your cabin.

If you bring your pet, please let us know prior to booking. We have coyotes. You assume all risk and there is an extra fee.

Please note, if you’re staying 5 or more days you can use the washer and dryer. 

IF THIS CABIN IS BOOKED DURING YOUR IDEAL DATES, there is a second, private cabin on the property. Please check out  DTJT HOUSE 2.
 It''s quite baller!

Guest access
SHARING THE POOL: In the hot months, you will most likely share the pool with 1-2 other people from the other cabin. The pool is huge. Bigger than most if not all Palm Springs hotel pools! There are two shade structures with tables and chairs.  We find that most of our guests come for special occasions and value their privacy. We set it up for just that. We also find that there is little overlap because people have very different schedules. And even if you do overlap, the pool is effen huge! You''ll be fine.  Where else are you going to have a 50 foot salt water pool for these ideal prices? Spoiler alert. Nowhere. 

You each have your own hot tub! 

You do not have access to the other cabin, unless invited by the other guest(s). 

You DO NOT have access to the main/front house. This includes the front house fire pit, porch or surrounding areas/parking. There are cameras.

Other things to note
We built this place for you to enjoy. By coming here you are part of a community of people from all over the world that appreciate the houses. 

ANIMAL LIFE:
-We ask you not to eat in bed. It''s cool and sexy in the movies, but not so much in the desert. Unless you like ants. In your pants. Which I don''t. 

-You won''t see a snake. That doesn''t mean they''re not there. They don''t like humans. They''re the original quarantiners. 

-We have lots of jack rabbits and bunnies. Drive slow. You''ll feel like garbage if you hit a rabbit and it will most likely ruin your trip. Unless you''re a sociopath. No judgement. 

-Spiders and scorpions. Ew. I know I''m supposed to love all nature, but ew. An exterminator comes regularly. Not because I have lots of creatures, but because I don''t want to see any of them inside. Ever. 

-Coyotes – They’re around. All the time. You’ll hear them at dusk. Don’t feed them or interact with them. Seriously. If you did happen to bring a pet, DO NOT leave the doors open. You won’t have a pet in the morning. 

-Keep your eye out for our resident roadrunner (meep meep!) and keep your ears open for our great horned owl. It’s not your partner snoring.


DON''T BURN DOWN THE DESERT:
- You have two choices for an outdoor fireplace. One is wood burning and the other is proprane.  BYO wood. DO NOT EVER  leave the fire unattended and make sure that the fire is fully extinguished before you leave or fall asleep.

-No smoking inside. 

RANDOM:
-No additional guests to the swimming pool unless you pay an extra fee. It''s not fair to the other guests in Cabin 2. They have the same pool rules. 

-That said, please request beforehand if you want to bring an extra guest. We''re a more chill, laid back vibe and not an MTV spring break sort of place. You get it. 

- Be loving, mindful and filled with deep respect for ALL animals and nature.  If this is not taken into action you will be asked to leave and you will not be refunded.
